## *Career in Tech*
## 2010-Present

### • IT Leadership
### • Infrastructure
### • Operations
I've spent 14+ years in IT infrastructure and operations, from help desk to leadership. I've worn every hat and learned that technology is about people — building relationships that enable you to use tech and get real value from it.

Currently looking for my next IT leadership role in the Evansville, Indiana area.
