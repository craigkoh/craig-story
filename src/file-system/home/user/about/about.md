# Hi there

My name is Craig Kohler, and I'm an IT leader with 14+ years of experience in infrastructure and operations. I've worked my way up from help desk to leadership, and I've learned that tech isn't about the coolest gear — it's about people and relationships.

I was born and raised in Evansville, Indiana, and I'm currently looking for my next IT leadership role. When I'm not working, I'm diving into YouTube content creation and collecting vintage computers.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see what I've been working on.
